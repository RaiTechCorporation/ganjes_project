# Enhanced Security Audit - Ganjes Token (GNJS) v2.0

**Contract:** `contracts/gnjToken.sol` (Enhanced Version)  
**Date:** August 21, 2025  
**Auditor:** Security Analysis Post-Fixes  
**Version:** 2.0 (Security Enhanced)  

## Executive Summary

The Ganjes Token (GNJS) has been significantly enhanced with comprehensive security measures. All previously identified medium and low-risk issues have been addressed. The contract now implements enterprise-grade security with strict multi-signature governance enforcement.

**Overall Risk Level:** LOW (Previously MEDIUM)

## Security Improvements Made

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Previous Medium Risk Issues

- **New Features:**
  - Recipient validation (must be an owner)
  - Enhanced event logging
  - Only callable through governance
- **Security Level:** HIGH ‚úÖ

#### 3. ‚úÖ FIXED: Individual Owner Token Burning
