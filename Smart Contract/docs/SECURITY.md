# Ganjes DAO Security Documentation

## Security Overview

The Ganjes DAO implements multiple layers of security to protect user funds and ensure proper governance. This document outlines the security measures, potential risks, and best practices.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Access Control

#### Multi-Admin System
```solidity
mapping(address => bool) public admins;
address public admin; // Primary admin
uint256 public adminCount;
```

**Features:**
- Primary admin cannot be removed
- Maximum 10 admins to prevent bloat
- Admin functions require explicit admin role
- Admin addition/removal is logged

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Prevents single point of failure
- Transparent admin management
- Protected critical functions

#### Role-Based Permissions

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Any User** | Create proposals (with requirements), Vote, Claim refunds |
| **Admin** | Execute proposals, Manage settings, Emergency functions |
| **Primary Admin** | All admin functions, Cannot be removed |

### 2. Economic Security

#### Proposal Deposits
```solidity
uint256 public constant PROPOSAL_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT = 100 * 10**18;
```

**Purpose:**
- Prevents spam proposals
- Economic incentive for quality proposals
- Refunded if proposal fails

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Raises cost of attack
- Encourages genuine proposals
- Protects DAO resources

#### Investment Locks
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) investments;
```

**Features:**
- Tokens locked during voting period
- Released only after proposal execution
- Refundable for failed proposals

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Prevents vote manipulation
- Ensures commitment to proposals
- Protects investor funds

#### Funding Limits
```solidity
uint256 public constant MIN_FUNDING_GOAL = 10 * 10**18;
uint256 public constant MAX_FUNDING_GOAL = 1000000 * 10**18;
```

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Prevents dust proposals
- Limits maximum exposure
- Reasonable funding bounds

### 3. Technical Security

#### Reentrancy Protection
```solidity
import "./libraries/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
modifier nonReentrant()
```

**Protected Functions:**
- `createProposal()`
- `vote()`
- `executeProposal()`
- `claimRefund()`
- `emergencyWithdraw()`

**Attack Prevention:**
- Prevents recursive calls
- Protects state changes
- Secures token transfers

#### Pausable Contract
```solidity
import "./libraries/Pausable.sol";
modifier whenNotPausedCustom()
```

**Emergency Control:**
- Admin can pause/unpause contract
- Prevents operations during emergencies
- Allows time for incident response

#### Input Validation

**Comprehensive Checks:**
```solidity
// Address validation
modifier validAddress(address _addr) {
    if (_addr == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    _;
}

// Proposal validation
modifier validProposal(uint256 _proposalId) {
    if (_proposalId == 0 || _proposalId > proposalCount) {
        revert InvalidProposal(_proposalId);
    }
    _;
}

// Funding goal validation
if (_fundingGoal < MIN_FUNDING_GOAL || _fundingGoal > MAX_FUNDING_GOAL) {
    revert InvalidFundingGoal(_fundingGoal);
}
```

### 4. Gas Optimization Security

#### Custom Errors
```solidity
error InsufficientTokens(uint256 required, uint256 available);
error InvalidProposal(uint256 proposalId);
error ProposalCooldownActive(uint256 timeRemaining);
```

**Benefits:**
- Lower gas costs than string errors
- Detailed error information
- Consistent error handling

#### Efficient Data Structures
```solidity
struct Proposal {
    uint256 id;
    address proposer;
    uint32 votersFor;      // Packed for gas efficiency
    uint32 votersAgainst;  // Packed for gas efficiency
    bool executed;
    bool passed;
    bool depositRefunded;
    // ... other fields
}
```

## Attack Vectors & Mitigations

### 1. Governance Attacks

#### Vote Buying
**Risk:** Users selling votes for personal gain

**Mitigations:**
- Vote weight based on token balance (not investment)
- Investments locked until execution
- Economic incentives align with DAO success

#### Proposal Spam
**Risk:** Flooding DAO with low-quality proposals

**Mitigations:**
- 100 token deposit requirement
- 1-hour cooldown between proposals
- Maximum 10 proposals per user
- Minimum token balance required

#### Sybil Attacks
**Risk:** Single entity creating multiple accounts

**Mitigations:**
- Token requirement creates economic barrier
- Vote weight based on token holdings
- Proposal deposits reduce attack profitability

### 2. Economic Attacks

#### Flash Loan Attacks
**Risk:** Temporary token acquisition for voting

**Mitigations:**
- Investment tokens locked during voting
- Vote weight snapshot at voting time
- Economic cost of attack vs. benefit

#### Drain Attacks
**Risk:** Malicious proposals designed to drain treasury

**Mitigations:**
- Funding limits (max 1M tokens)
- Admin execution requirement
- Community oversight
- Emergency pause capability

#### Reentrancy Attacks
**Risk:** Recursive calls to exploit state changes

**Mitigations:**
- ReentrancyGuard on all critical functions
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- External call safety

### 3. Technical Attacks

#### Integer Overflow/Underflow
**Risk:** Arithmetic operations causing unexpected behavior

**Mitigations:**
- Solidity 0.8+ built-in overflow protection
- Explicit bounds checking
- SafeMath patterns where needed

#### Front-Running
**Risk:** MEV extraction from transaction ordering

**Mitigations:**
- Voting mechanics reduce front-running value
- Investment commitments locked
- Time-based voting periods

## Emergency Procedures

### 1. Contract Pause

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Unexpected behavior detected
- External dependency compromise

**Actions:**
```solidity
function pause() external onlyAdmin {
    _pause();
}
```

**Effects:**
- Stops all non-emergency functions
- Allows emergency withdrawals only
- Preserves state for investigation

### 2. Emergency Withdrawal

**Limited Scope:**
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_EMERGENCY_WITHDRAW_PERCENT = 5;
```

**Requirements:**
- Admin authorization required
- Maximum 5% of total balance
- Reason must be provided
- Event logged for transparency

**Process:**
```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw(
    uint256 _amount, 
    address _to, 
    string calldata _reason
) external onlyAdmin validAddress(_to) nonReentrant
```

### 3. Admin Management

**Adding Admins:**
- Current admin authorization required
- Maximum 10 admins enforced
- Addition event logged

**Removing Admins:**
- Cannot remove primary admin
- Must maintain at least one admin
- Removal event logged
