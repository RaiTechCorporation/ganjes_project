## Overview

The Ganjes DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that allows token holders to propose and vote on funding projects. The system uses a proposal-based governance model where:

- **Proposers** create funding requests for their projects
- **Investors** vote by investing tokens in proposals they support
- **Successful proposals** receive funding from the DAO treasury
- **Failed proposals** allow investors to claim refunds

## Requirements

### For Creating Proposals

| Requirement | Amount | Purpose |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| **Minimum Token Balance** | 100 tokens | Ensures proposer has stake in DAO |
| **Proposal Deposit** | 100 tokens | Prevents spam, refunded if proposal fails |
| **Total Required** | 100 tokens | Deposited when creating proposal |

### Additional Constraints

- **Cooldown Period**: 1 hour between proposals per user
- **Maximum Proposals**: 10 proposals per user
- **Funding Goal Range**: 10 - 1,000,000 tokens
- **Voting Duration**: 5 minutes (configurable by admin)

## Creating Proposals

### Method 1: Interactive Script (Recommended)

```bash
npm run create-proposal
```

This launches an interactive CLI that guides you through:

1. **Account Verification**
   - Checks token balance
   - Validates proposal requirements
   - Shows current allowances

2. **Proposal Details Input**
   - Project name
   - Project URL
   - Funding goal (in tokens)
   - Detailed description

3. **Validation & Confirmation**
   - Input validation
   - Proposal summary review
   - Final confirmation

4. **Submission**
   - Automatic token approval if needed
   - Transaction submission
   - Confirmation and proposal ID

### Method 2: Test Proposal

```bash
npm run test-proposal
```

Creates a pre-configured test proposal with sample data for testing purposes.

### Method 3: Direct Contract Interaction

```solidity
function createProposal(
    string calldata _description, 
    string calldata _projectName,
    string calldata _projectUrl,
    uint256 _fundingGoal
) external
```

## Proposal Lifecycle

### 1. Creation Phase
```
User submits proposal ‚Üí Deposit locked ‚Üí Proposal ID assigned ‚Üí Voting begins
```

**Requirements Met:**
- ‚úÖ Sufficient token balance
- ‚úÖ Approved token spending
- ‚úÖ Valid funding goal
- ‚úÖ Cooldown period passed
- ‚úÖ Below maximum proposals

### 2. Voting Phase
```
Proposal active ‚Üí Users vote + invest ‚Üí Voting period ends
```

**Duration:** 5 minutes (default, admin configurable)

**Voting Rules:**
- Proposers cannot vote on their own proposals
- Minimum investment required to vote
- Vote weight = voter's token balance
- Investment locked until proposal execution

### 3. Execution Phase
```
Voting ends ‚Üí Admin executes ‚Üí Funds distributed OR refunds available
```

**Success Criteria (either one):**
1. **Funding Target Met**: Total investments ‚â• funding goal
2. **Voting Success**: Quorum reached AND more votes for than against

**Outcomes:**
- **‚úÖ Success**: Proposer receives funding + deposit refund
- **‚ùå Failure**: Investors can claim refunds, proposer can claim deposit

### 4. Post-Execution
```
Proposal executed ‚Üí Funds claimed ‚Üí Records updated
```

## Voting System

### How to Vote

Voting requires investing tokens in the proposal:

```solidity
function vote(
    uint256 _proposalId, 
    bool _support, 
    uint256 _investmentAmount
) external
```

### Voting Mechanics

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `_proposalId` | ID of proposal to vote on |
| `_support` | `true` for support, `false` for against |
| `_investmentAmount` | Tokens to invest (minimum required) |

### Vote Weight Calculation

```
Vote Weight = Voter's Total Token Balance
Investment = Separate token amount locked in proposal
```

### Investment Rules

- **Minimum**: Set by admin (default: 10 tokens)
- **Maximum**: Cannot exceed proposal funding goal
- **Lock Period**: Until proposal execution
- **Refund**: Available if proposal fails

## Scripts Usage

### Interactive Proposal Creation

```bash
npm run create-proposal
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Insufficient Token Balance
```
‚ùå Error: InsufficientTokens(100000000000000000000, 50000000000000000000)
```
**Solution**: Ensure you have at least 100 tokens in your wallet.

#### 2. Insufficient Allowance
```
‚ùå Error: InsufficientAllowance(100000000000000000000, 0)
```
**Solution**: The script will automatically approve tokens, or manually approve:
```javascript
await token.approve(daoAddress, ethers.parseEther("100"));
```

#### 3. Proposal Cooldown Active
```
‚ùå Error: ProposalCooldownActive(2847)
```
**Solution**: Wait for the cooldown period to end (shown in seconds).

#### 4. Maximum Proposals Reached
```
‚ùå Error: MaxProposalsReached(10)
```
**Solution**: You've reached the maximum of 10 proposals per user.

#### 5. Invalid Funding Goal
```
‚ùå Error: InvalidFundingGoal(5000000000000000000)
```
**Solution**: Ensure funding goal is between 10 and 1,000,000 tokens.

### Network Issues

#### 1. Wrong Network
Ensure you're connected to BSC Testnet:
```
RPC URL: https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/
Chain ID: 97
```

#### 2. Gas Issues
If transactions fail due to gas:
```javascript
// Increase gas limit in transaction
const tx = await dao.createProposal(..., { gasLimit: 500000 });
```

### Contract Issues

#### 1. Contract Paused
```
‚ùå Error: ContractPaused()
```
**Solution**: Wait for admin to unpause the contract.

#### 2. Invalid Proposal ID
```
‚ùå Error: InvalidProposal(999)
```
**Solution**: Use valid proposal ID (1 to current proposal count).

   - Not too low (minimum 10 tokens)
   - Not too high (maximum 1M tokens)
   - Realistic for project scope

### For Voters/Investors

1. **Due Diligence**
   - Review project documentation
   - Check proposer's history
   - Assess feasibility

2. **Investment Strategy**
   - Only invest what you can afford
   - Consider proposal success likelihood
   - Remember investments are locked until execution

3. **Active Participation**
   - Vote on proposals you evaluate
   - Engage with proposer for clarifications
   - Monitor proposal progress

## FAQ

### Q: How long does voting last?
**A:** Default is 5 minutes, but admins can configure this between 1 minute and 30 days.

### Q: Can I change my vote?
**A:** No, votes are final once submitted.

### Q: What happens if I don't vote?

### Q: Can I vote on multiple proposals?
**A:** Yes, you can vote on as many proposals as you want (subject to token balance).

### Q: How do I get my deposit back?
**A:** For failed proposals, call `claimRefund()`. For successful proposals, deposits are automatically refunded.

### Q: Can admins vote?
**A:** Yes, admins can vote like any other token holder, but cannot vote on their own proposals.

### Q: What happens if the DAO runs out of funds?
**A:** Proposals requiring more funding than available will fail, but investors can still claim refunds.
