# OpenZeppelin Style Security Audit - Ganjes Token (GNJS)

**Contract:** `contracts/gnjToken.sol`  
**Date:** August 21, 2025  
**Auditor:** Security Analysis  
**Version:** 1.0  

## Executive Summary

The Ganjes Token (GNJS) is a BEP20-compatible token with multi-signature governance, pause functionality, and burn capability. The contract implements several security measures but has some areas for improvement.

**Overall Risk Level:** MEDIUM

## Contract Overview

- **Total Supply:** 10,000,000 GNJS (Fixed)
- **Decimals:** 18
- **Governance:** Multi-signature with timelock
- **Features:** Pausable, Burnable, Reentrancy Protection

## Security Assessment

### ‚úÖ STRENGTHS

#### 1. Multi-Signature Governance Implementation
- **Location:** Lines 65-316
- **Assessment:** SECURE
- Proper multi-signature implementation with timelock protection
- 24-hour delay for critical operations
- Multiple owner system with configurable confirmation requirements
- Proper event logging for all governance actions

#### 2. Reentrancy Protection
- **Location:** Lines 369-392
- **Assessment:** SECURE
- Custom ReentrancyGuard implementation following OpenZeppelin patterns
- Applied to critical functions like `burn()` and `burnFrom()`

#### 3. Pausable Mechanism
- **Location:** Lines 322-363
- **Assessment:** SECURE
- Proper pause/unpause functionality
- Emergency pause function without timelock for critical situations
- All transfer functions respect pause state

#### 4. Fixed Supply Model
- **Location:** Lines 426, 431, 457
- **Assessment:** SECURE
- No minting functions present
- Supply is permanently fixed at 10M tokens
- Clear documentation of fixed supply nature

### ‚ö†Ô∏è  MEDIUM RISK ISSUES

#### 1. Direct Admin Function Calls
- **Location:** Lines 561-584
- **Risk:** MEDIUM
- **Issue:** Admin functions `pause()`, `unpause()`, and `emergencyPause()` can be called directly by owners, bypassing multi-sig governance
- **Impact:** Centralization risk, defeats purpose of multi-sig timelock
- **Recommendation:** These functions should only be callable through multi-sig transactions

#### 2. Emergency Withdrawal Function
- **Location:** Lines 720-726
- **Risk:** MEDIUM
- **Issue:** `emergencyWithdraw()` can be called directly by any owner
- **Impact:** Potential for unauthorized token extraction
- **Recommendation:** Should require multi-sig approval and timelock

#### 3. Owner Privilege Escalation
- **Location:** Lines 594-597
- **Risk:** MEDIUM
- **Issue:** `burn()` function allows any owner to burn tokens from their balance without multi-sig approval
- **Impact:** Individual owners can make unilateral decisions affecting token supply
- **Recommendation:** Consider requiring multi-sig for large burn amounts

### üîç LOW RISK ISSUES

#### 1. Missing Input Validation
- **Location:** Lines 654-670
- **Risk:** LOW
- **Issue:** Transfer functions don't validate recipient addresses against known contract addresses
- **Recommendation:** Consider blacklist functionality for known problematic addresses

#### 2. Event Logging Gaps
- **Location:** Various
- **Risk:** LOW
- **Issue:** Some admin actions don't emit specific events
- **Recommendation:** Add more detailed event logging for better transparency

### ‚úÖ SECURE IMPLEMENTATIONS

#### 1. Standard BEP20 Functions
- All transfer, approval, and allowance functions follow BEP20 standard
- Proper overflow/underflow protection using unchecked blocks appropriately
- Correct event emissions

#### 2. Access Control
- Multi-signature system properly implemented
- Owner checks in place for admin functions
- Proper modifier usage

#### 3. Mathematical Operations
- Safe arithmetic operations
- No integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities
- Proper use of unchecked blocks for gas optimization

## Compliance Analysis

### OpenZeppelin Standards Compliance

| Standard | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|
| ERC20 | ‚úÖ COMPLIANT | Full BEP20 (ERC20 extension) compliance |
| Ownable | ‚úÖ ENHANCED | Multi-sig implementation exceeds standard |
| Pausable | ‚úÖ COMPLIANT | Proper implementation |
| ReentrancyGuard | ‚úÖ COMPLIANT | Custom but secure implementation |

### Best Practices Assessment

| Practice | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Check-Effects-Interactions | ‚úÖ FOLLOWED | Proper pattern in all functions |
| Access Control | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | Direct admin calls bypass multi-sig |
| Event Logging | ‚úÖ ADEQUATE | Good event coverage |
| Input Validation | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | Missing some edge case validations |
| Gas Optimization | ‚úÖ GOOD | Efficient implementation |

## Recommendations

### HIGH PRIORITY

1. **Enforce Multi-Sig for All Admin Functions**
   ```solidity
   // Remove direct callable admin functions
   // All admin actions should go through submitTransaction()
   ```

2. **Implement Emergency Withdrawal Safeguards**
   ```solidity
   // Add multi-sig requirement and timelock for emergency withdrawals
   ```

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

1. **Add Burn Amount Limits**
   ```solidity
   // Consider daily/total burn limits for individual owners
   ```

2. **Enhanced Event Logging**
   ```solidity
   // Add more detailed events for transparency
   ```

### LOW PRIORITY

1. **Address Validation**
   ```solidity
   // Add blacklist functionality if needed
   ```

## Gas Analysis

- **Deployment Cost:** ~3.5M gas (estimated)
- **Transfer Cost:** ~51,000 gas
- **Multi-sig Operations:** ~150,000-300,000 gas
- **Overall Efficiency:** GOOD

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Multi-Signature Flow Testing**
   - Test all confirmation scenarios
   - Verify timelock enforcement
   - Test transaction execution

2. **Pause/Unpause Testing**
   - Test emergency scenarios
   - Verify state changes
   - Test access controls

3. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Zero amount transfers
   - Maximum value operations
   - Revert conditions

## Conclusion

The Ganjes Token contract implements solid security practices with multi-signature governance and proper access controls. However, the direct callable admin functions create a centralization risk that should be addressed. The contract is generally secure but would benefit from enforcing all admin actions through the multi-signature process.

**Recommendation:** Address the medium-risk issues before deployment, particularly the direct admin function calls that bypass multi-sig governance.
